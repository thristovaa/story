                        <h2>Captain Morgan</h2>
                        <p>Captain Morgan is a weathered and rugged figure, with salt-and-pepper hair that falls in untamed waves around his shoulders. His face bears the scars of countless battles, with a weather-beaten complexion and a steely gaze that reflects his determination and leadership.</p>
                        <p>A patch covers one of Captain Morgan's eyes, a reminder of a past skirmish that left him scarred but undeterred. His remaining eye, a piercing shade of blue, holds a depth of knowledge and experience that belies his years. It gleams with determination and unwavering resolve, a beacon of leadership for his crewmates to follow.</p>
                        <p>His features are weather-beaten and lined with the wrinkles of age, but they carry an air of authority and command that demands attention. A well-trimmed beard frames his jawline, its dark hue streaked with silver, while a faint scar traces a path across one cheek, a silent testament to the dangers of his chosen profession.</p>

His frame is broad and muscular, a testament to a lifetime spent in battle and conquest, while his imposing stature seems to loom over those who dare to challenge him.</p>
                        <p>Blackbeard's Shadow is known for his mane of dark hair, which cascades down his back like a waterfall of midnight silk. His beard, a tangled mass of wiry strands streaked with silver, billows in the wind like smoke from a raging fire, giving him an air of menace and intimidation that few can match.</p>
